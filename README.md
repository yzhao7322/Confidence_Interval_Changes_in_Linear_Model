# Confidence_Interval_Changes_in_Linear_Model
This repository provides codes for implementing the procedure in the paper "Confidence intervals for multiple change points in linear models with heteroscedastic errors", by Lajos Horvath, Gregory Rice, Yuqian Zhao

R code:

confidence_interval_functions.R - functions to load for implementing the main methods

ilr_code.R - functions to load for implementing the ILR method (Eo and Morley, 2015)

data_applications.R - data application replication code

simulation_demo.R - simulation demo for models with HeteroIID errors


Data:

pcurve.csv - Data application 1 in Section 6

crypfactors.csv - Data application 2 in Online supplement Section E
